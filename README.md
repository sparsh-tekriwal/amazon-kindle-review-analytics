### Analysis of Reviews of Amazon Kindle Devices 

- In this notebook, I analyzed a set of reviews extracted from reviews for the Kindle device on Amazon to identify elements of a review that customers view as positive and negative. 
- I build a simple model to predict where a review will correspond to a 5-star rating based on the text in the review, and identified attributes of the reviews themselves that lead to other customers finding that review helpful.
